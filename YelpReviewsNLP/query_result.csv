They are grilling chicken, ribs, and pork chops right in the parking lot and although I haven't tried the ribs, the grilled pork chops and chicken are perfectly cooked.  I also tried the fried chicken, green beans, lima beans, potato salad, stewed squash, and seafood salad...all excellent!  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the Mac n cheese.

Soft flavorful bread (you are already ahead of the game because Subway and Jimmy John have hard and/or bland bread). Fresh sliced meats, cheeses and veggies (sorry but S & JJ have slimy meat and that's a HUGE turn-off), and when you take a bite of your sandwich and all of the mayo/mustard/vinegar/oregano have magically melded together...you'll be a believer too. Prices are slightly higher than Subway, pretty similar to Jimmy John, but the quality leaves them in the dust. My only suggestion would be for them to start a delivery service or subscribe to Grubhub.com or something like that so I could order it for our lunch meetings. 

Oh and the service is always done with a smile. Great job guys!",1,0,1,"duHFBe87uNSXImQmvBh87Q","mzHRaYLoV-lwX79HghP6lw"

The good side of this place is that there's hardly ever a wait.  Even with a line, things move quickly and efficiently.  Menu selection is decent, prices are fair, and there's plenty of indoor seating.  They have a nice bread selection here, which I like as well.

Downside?  I kinda find Blimpie's subs to be...well, mediocure.  Its by far 10 million times better then Subway any day..but not enough to really impress my tastebuds.

On a sign in the window was advertised the new Hoboken Hero with salami, pepperoni, prosciuttini and provolone. I requested double meat and double cheese as I used to back east and the sandwich maker proceeded to quickly build my hero. I was pleased to see that Blimpie still slices most meats to order unlike many sandwich shops where it's unknown how long ago ingredients were prepped. (Have you ever seen a slicer at Subway? I sure haven't.) Parmesan bread was fresh and baked perfectly. One aspect of the older Blimpie stores back east is they tend to be shabby and unkempt however this shop is in ship shape; immaculately clean and bright with large almost floor to ceiling windows running the full length of the store. Customer service was on point and delivered with a smile. One bit of irony is I was helped by, and I kid you not, Jared!

So I went, and I explained that it would be nasty but they said let's give it a try so we did.  When we got inside I noticed that the music was soo loud that it's they were having a concert for the neighborhood, it was soo cold in there that it was warmer outside and it's the fall people.  Any who, our server was in the back laying down when we were greeted, he finally came to our table very nice guy and he was the high light of the whole visit even though it didn't start off well.  We ordered our food, the choices were not good not enough of a selection.  Any way, we all ordered our food and waited, for some reason we didn't notice that we didn't have eating utensils until I food came.  Our server didn't even realize it, so my question is why wasn't the tables set at the time of opening?  Ok I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and I must say that the bacon was the best part of the burger.  Applebee's has the most flavorless food I've ever had in my whole life, and yall know I like to eat...lol.  Any who, it was horrible I had to make my self get through most of the burger because I was hunger, normally I would complain and not pay for it and move on.  But I just was ready to go at this point, when I got my food my fries were so cold it's like they had just taken them from the refridgerator, so he took them back and I got more not too much better so I just let it be.

I will never ever ever in my whole life even if it's the last place on earth to eat, even if their are no more grocery stores, and I can't grow my own food ever ever eat at Applebee's again.

You'd never find this place if you weren't looking for it - a tiny little diner near the hospital. Their hours are somewhat erratic, I believe they're closed Fridays and only open until 1 on Saturday. Upon entering you're greeted with a prominent view of the kitchen(One guy cooking on what appears to be a standard stove), a breakfast bar that seats about 15, and about 10 tables that could seat 2-4.  We sat ourselves at one of the few open tables, the people inside were a few senior couples, one lone older man at the counter, and a young couple. Just about everyone seemed to be a regular and know each other by name. 

Their menu lists breakfast and lunch, with most of their 'a la carte' breakfast items being a few bucks each, and their breakfast plates being about $5. I got an egg sandwich with homefries and coffee for $5, my girlfriend got 2 eggs with toast, homefries, and juice for $6. My girlfriend asked if instead of meat she could get cheese and the eggs scrambled. When the waitress took the order back the guy behind the counter started at the slip in a \"what the hell?\" kind of way but didn't complain.

Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes, a large plate which had a sizable amount of food on it considering the price, and very few frills. Our coffee was kept full and our order was correct, no items having been forgotten. None of the food was notably good, but it was all tasty and had a \"homecooked\"(\"rustic\"?) feel to it. Also, bonus points that the eggs and homefries we were served were not dripping in industrial butter-like oil.

A point worth noting is that while our waitress was very nice to us, it appears they are happy to tell it to you like it is, telling and older man who seemed to be a regular after quite a bit of chit-chat that if he couldn't finish his meal by 1pm then he ought to not bother ordering.

In one session, the guys decided to give me a break and do take out at a local wing place.  After searching online, we found Wild Wing with it's ridiculously HUGE flavour menu.  We called and ordered $50 worth of wings that allowed us to choose up to 5 flavours.  They told us to come pick it up in 45 minutes.

When the guys went to go grab it at the 45 minute mark and they noted that the wings seemed to be lukewarm instead of hot.  It's great that the store made it faster than the alloted 45 minute but not so good when you do pick up and it's not fresh.  For $50, you get a fairly large bucket of wings.  I would say we probably counted around 30 to 35 wings or so.  The wing size were medium.  Some were scrawnier than others but they were ok meat wise.

In terms of the flavours, we got naked lemon pepper, honey garlic, desperado (a hot maple bbq), texas honey, and spicy bbq.  From a spiciness perspective, the medium heat isn't so bad.  If anything, I would say they're on the tamer side so anyone who is really worried about heat level... these won't kill you.  From a flavour perspective, they were ok.  I did like the naked lemon pepper the most as weren't sauced and you just had the deep fried crunch with a citrus touch.  I found the sauced wings not great and it's possible from the fact they just sat in the sauce too long.  They weren't crispy under the sauce and some of the sweet ones (like texas honey) were just too sweet... almost cloying.

Overall, it's not a bad option but I think the superstore chicken wings are just as decent and considerably cheaper (especially when they have deals!)",0,1,0,"qnpvw-uQyRn9nlClWFK9aA","PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA"

Sometimes one does not know if the bartender is busy or the food is not ready.  The bartenders need to let the customer know the status of the order.  If it is still being cooked, that is fine.  If the bartender is not managing to at least connect with the kitchen, then management needs to review the the communication process between the bartender and the kitchen.  Perhaps the bartenders need to be aware that they have two priorities, serving drinks and taking care of takeouts.  Both are of equal importance and communication to both guest needs deserve the same treatment.  May I commend the reception attention as one walks in.  The guest is rapidly greeted and ready to direct them to what their express needs are.  A few times we paid in the reception area.  Recently we were redirected to the bar.  Perhaps this is a seasonal change since  the summer months are very busy and the lobby can get congested.  I am not really sure of the change.  If the bar is very busy, then there is more competition to get even the waitress's attention.  However, the food is worth this small, needed refinement.

"g521IqMBKGAQH-VBnbUJoA",2,"2017-03-23 00:00:00","UPDATE: had the most disappointing experience here tonight. Decided to go to this Red Lobster after a long evening. I was starved, it was my birthday, and the 3 of us agreed in this place. We arrived by about 8:00 so there was no waiting for a table. We were seated immediately and had our orders taken promptly by our friendly waiter. So far so good. We chose not to order an appetizer since it was already late, figuring a salad and dinner would be plenty so late into the evening. Here's where it starts to go down hill.
Strike 1-Our salads arrived, but we didn't have any silverware.  Had to request silverware. Then noticed that my salad had wilting, dark, aging leaves. More than one was found. Yuck. 
After we were finished with our salads, he asked if we'd like anymore biscuits but we declined, trying to save room for our meal. 
Strike 2-we wait, AND WAIT for our food. 30 minutes go by and still nothing. Out waiter finally comes over to apologize for the mess up. He forgot to put our orders in, but he just did, so it shouldn't be too long before they're ready. 
During this time we see 3 other sets of guests who are seated, ordered and received their food.... as we wait, and wait. 
Strike 3-Our waiter never checked in with us to offer any more biscuits or ANYTHING, as an \"I'm sorry for the mistake, what can I do to satisfy you in the meantime\" during our long wait. Nothing. 
Strike 4- Our food finally arrives. It's been about a 45 minute wait from the time our salad plates had been cleared til our entrees were brought out. 
Strike 5- waiter forgets a cup of soup that was ordered. 
By now, we're just eager to eat and get out and go home. 
Strike 6- offered one of us a lemonade refill, but forgot to bring it. Never checked on the rest of our drinks  or offered to refill them. Our glasses were empty before our meal was finished, and they stayed that way. 
Food was basically as I rated previously. Overly salted, nearly swimming in oil and on top of that, it was super late. 
Our waiter apologized and said he was going to take the soup off our bill and give us a free dessert if we'd like to make up for the mistake. 
I'm sorry, but in a situation like this I would expect the wait person to speak with the manager and offer a free meal or something.... not a free cup of soup. 
I'm not one to normally criticize waitstaff, because I know they work hard and customers can be rude and impatient, but I really felt like we were not taken care of during this visit. I don't know if our waiter was new, tired, or just unaware, but I don't think we'll be back to this restaurant anytime soon.

The service! Our server (who I believe is actually the bartender) couldn't have provided better service. 

The food. We didn't have an issue with the food being overly salty like others have. Their famous biscuits were perfect (and we got extras to take home), the crab linguini alfredo was tasty with large pieces of crab throughout, and there are no words to describe how delicious the vanilla bean cheesecake is. The cheesecake is a seasonal promotion for now, but I'm really hoping they keep it on the menu since they got rid of the plain cheesecake.

The cons- 
First, the wait. We came in at about 1:30pm on a Tuesday and were told the wait would be about 15 minutes. 30 minutes later we got our seats, even though we could see open tables for most of our wait. I'm guessing this is a staffing issue, and willing to consider that this might have been an unexpectedly busy afternoon for them. 

Like other reviewers have pointed out, our salads also had dark, aged lettuce, although I wouldn't describe it as making up half the salad as some have. Still, it's clear that this is not a new issue for them.

I'd definitely go back, especially for more of the vanilla bean cheesecake before the promotion ends.",1,0,0,"TXiEgINSZ75d3EtvLvkc4Q","NDnBv2zS4uV0TTjDq9xi0w"

I love seafood. It's my favorite food. However, Red Lobster seems to think that the best way to cook a good seafood dish is to drown it in garlic and butter. My goodness, it's ridiculous how much butter and oil is used in any given dish. I am (was) a huge fan of their Salmon New Orleans. It came with wild rice, broccoli, broiled salmon and shrimp covered in a tabasco butter sauce. I always got the sauce on the side because again, the add too much butter/oil. Since the dish is super easy to make, I decided to make it on my own with less butter. Viola! Dish turned out better than Red Lobster (IMO which is very bias I will admit) For what you pay to get a good meal, the food is very average while being coated in nothing but butter. Even the salads are iffy. 

Their food is nothing special. The most decent cooker can make anything on their menu. I never understood why the lines are always out of the damn door when I drive by on a weekend. Convenience? Must be. However, people must REALLY like it considering the wait time on a Friday or Saturday night can be up to a hour.

First off, we were greeted by two young ladies in the front. Prompt. Polite. We were already impressed.

Our server was Wes and can I just say, he was the easily the best server we've had yet. Everything he did seemed effortless and the attention to small details were not ignored. Very polite, patient, knowledgeable, prompt--he didn't miss a beat and he didn't overdo it by constantly coming to our table. It was a seamlessly perfect dinner. At Red Lobster. WHO KNEW?!

We chose the 4-course meal which was a good thing and a bad thing. Mostly good. The bad was based on the fact we couldn't get out of our seats. 

We started off with soup: spicy chicken tortilla and New England clam chowder. Not out of this world, but still good and perfect complement to the mini-blizzard going on outside.

I had the shrimp and scallop linguini; rich and creamy but it was a perfect portion. I didn't feel like it was an overwhelming amount. Thank goodness because I ate the entire thing and I feel no guilt! =)

My boyfriend had the wood-grilled chicken with portobello wine sauce. That was also a nice portion, and the green beans were well-seasoned. We could've eaten an entire plate of that with no problem. I didn't get a chance to taste the chicken but he took it home and ate it for a late-dinner. No complaints from him as far as I know.

Desserts were a triple-chocolate brownie a la mode and caramel cheesecake. RICH. RICH. RICH. Good gracious--what a way to top off the meal. At first I was a little annoyed by the small portion, but as soon as I took a bite, I was so glad they were that size. I think my pants would've hated me. 

Huge kudos to the management and staff (especially you, Wes!) for such a great experience. We were already having a somewhat off night and we took a chance to come eat here again, hoping it wouldn't be like the first time. Not even close.

And I know the exterior was changed but I could swear the inside was remodeled as well. It just didn't seem like previous experiences at other Red Lobster locations where I felt like I was on a fishery boat. Regardless, two thumbs up!",1,0,1,"TXiEgINSZ75d3EtvLvkc4Q","BXuxdO-lBL4tdg1-AthsaQ"

We were given the standard spiel with the current promotion \"lobsterfest\".  And boy, were they selling it hard.  I know the servers have to do it, but I found it annoying.  We ordered some waters with lemon.

Water arrive promptly w/o lemon.  No big deal.  Wife gets shrimp 3 ways.  I get a steak and salmon meal.  We both ordered Caesar salads.  I've never had a salad with more bad lettuce than what was brought to me.  At least half the lettuce was wilted and dark green/black slimy looking.  I told the server and he promptly brought out a different house salad.  It was fine, but the kitchen should know never to send anything out looking like that.

Our meals took a long time to arrive.  Must have been a good 40 minutes.  The food was decent enough.  My steak was rather bland.  But the salmon was good.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp.

When the bill came, it said waters w/ lemon.  Everyone has off days, I get it.  A number of points during the experience rubbed me the wrong way.

Now I love me some seafood; especially crab legs.  Red lobster always has on there menu 1/2, 1, or 2# of crab legs either alone with a salad or in a steamer with baby red potatoes and a chewy little half cob of corn. 
Price is excellent. The best time to go is actually around 2:30 during the week or 4:00 on a weekend.  The service here is very nice.  Always acknowledged at the door and seated as soon as possible.  Drink orders are taken in a few minutes and then a bit later the entree ordering happens. Then.... The cheddar garlic biscuits arrive!  Every time I try so hard not to eat the biscuits because first of all they're loaded with kcals, and secondly they're very filling.  
Then salads arrive and I have to remind myself not to talk too much because before you know it the entrees are there.  That's the lack of 5th star.... I always feel incredibly rushed.  The crab legs come out perfectly steamed and along with the proper little utensils to crack if you need and pick the luscious crabmeat out if it's shells.

They didn't have the big mushroom caps for my friends burger so they gave her two small ones didn't charge her, which was really nice.

The meat itself isn't a five-star patty, but it is juicy and tasty and obviously, it's the toppings and sides that really make the visit.  I like the bun they use (thick and a bit crusty).  My fave burger is the Tom Green - gouda, bacon, avocado slices and beech house sauce.  God, it's delicious.  I had previously tried the Nacho Libre, which I didn't think was anything amazing.  My husband always gets the ring of fire (an onion ring on top of the burger and filled with hotter than hell sauce), and he loves it.  Caution, it's ridiculously spicy.  

The onion rings are fantastic (I love breaded rings) and the choice of dips is fantastic.  I enjoy the beech house (like, what is IN that??? so good), the bacon/garlic aioli, the chipotle dip, sweet and spicy, ok ok, i like them all.  

Fries are really too salty, I don't even think I will order them again.  Doesn't matter though b/c the onion rings are all I need.

After perusing the menu for about 10 minutes and enjoying a beverage while trying to figure out what i wanted to eat, i noticed they also had different selections of meat to choose from.  I finally decided on the Teriyaki melt with Coleslaw and ask for the patty to be Elk.  I asked that they not put any mushrooms on my burger and substitute caramelized onions instead.   With Elk being such  a lean meat and i like wild game and its been  a while since i had elk so the test is to see if they over cook a lean meat like this.  I'm experienced and ready to pass judgment.  It takes a while for the food to come but i had a pleasant waitress named Jaden and games on my phone to keep me occupied until my meal arrived.  Still enjoying that beverage i mentioned at the beginning by the way.  So my meal arrives and i decided to try the coleslaw first.  Now that was not what i expected but it was the kind of good surprise for a change.  They use some type of pepper mayo in the slaw, and if i heard her right it has a bit of Jalapeno in it.  That slaw had some kick but it was good.  I can honestly say i have never had anything like it before and found it quite creative and appealing for those who like a bit of spice.  Next the burger.  I love Teriyaki and i love elk so if they did it wrong it will be a disaster.  Fortunately for me, they did it right.  The burger was juicy and the Teriyaki seemed to soak right in and keep it moist like it should be.  Elk is  a difficult protein to cook and some people can turn it into shoe leather real quick so the cook was on his game tonight.  Now it was a bit pricey for a burger but if you do it right it will be worth every penny.   Also i like the restaurant itself.  It looked like they could open up the garage door sized windows in the summer which i think i s cool, and the place is clean and modern and trendy.  Once you get past choice overload, its all good.

It was the busiest I had ever seen it, but we managed to snag the last table upon arrival. Who could resist their burgers at this price? I decided I would finally try the Elk on a Beech burger since it is the most expensive option on the menu. It was pretty good, but I did not find it was exceptionally better than some of their other creations I have tried. I do love it's uniqueness because where else do you find an Elk burger? Based on the price though I wouldn't get it again. I still can't get over how good their onion rings are, my favourite! Haven't found any that are better yet.

Don't forget to join their WIP loyalty program because it is so worth it! They give you $15 on your birthday if you use the card at least once before it occurs and $10 for every 150 points. I know a lot of people say it's pricey and it is, but at least this program helps to recover some of the costs. For example, I managed to get 150 points on my card and then my birthday passed so I had $25 available to spend. I used my card to pay for my meal (which was already discounted thanks to their birthday special) that was less than $10 with tip so essentially I dined for free. Also fill out their online survey with your receipt to receive $5 off on your next visit when you spend $20 or more. See tons of ways to save some money and enjoy a great burger!

I also want to mention that the service we received from Nick was excellent. Really cool guy and a great server! Also as another review mentioned, if you sit by the garage door, it is pretty cold!

Hearing that there was a place closer to us in Pickering, we dragged my parents along to finally try what we considered to be the perfected (and creative) burger, and were profoundly disappointed.

First off, nearly everything we ordered was overdone. 3 of us ordered Elk burgers (which take 20 minutes longer than beef to be prepared, and cost $4 extra), all of which were left on the grill too long. The fries, even the /fries/ were overcooked, rendering them completely inedible. The only mildly redeeming part about the meal was the $10 tower of onion rings we ordered as an appetizer which we weren't served plates for.

Apart from the food, the service was severely lacking; Our waitress was cheery enough, but was pretty incompetent the entire night. Ordering was kind of a hassle. At the end of the meal, my boyfriend jokingly asked for his water to be \"wrapped up to go.\" She reached for it before everyone looked at her, and she caught on. Long night.

We came with friends who'd seen a write-up in the News Advertiser. None of us had been. The decor is construction-themed and is divided into smaller groups of tables so it's not one big room. They're prepared for patio season with 2 large glass garage door style walls which will open to the outside (in cooler weather, the glass can be cold to sit next to as we experienced last night).  It was a packed Saturday night. Service was friendly. It did take awhile for our food to arrive. 

A couple of us tried the shakes, served in Anchor glass measuring cups, almost too thick to drink through the straws. His was chocolate and he thought it was OK. Mine was chocolate banana (minus the banana syrup as I don't like artificial banana), with real banana. It was great! Very filling, though 

We saw a tower of onion rings with dipping sauces that looked great. Two of us opted for the side dish upgrade to onion rings (+$3.56), one got fries and the other the spicy chips, made fresh.  The chips aren't too spicy. You get a bit of a kick at the end. The kid chose a traditional poutine and finished every bite. 

The burgers with sides range from $10.98 to $13.96. They include everything from the usual toppings (on a Plain Jane) to pear, peanut butter, Brie, tiger shrimp, Montreal smoked meat, and so on.  

They had a turkey dinner burger on special which featured stuffing and gravy and cranberry sauce. 

I had the Porkgasm which had field mushrooms, smokey BBQ, cheddar and double-smoked bacon. The burger was well-done, but with the juice from the mushrooms and BBQ sauce, it exploded juice out the sides and up my arm to my elbow at first bite!  Expecting it was over, I tried again. My next bite sent juice onto my other arm and onto my table-mate. After a number of apologies and some extra napkins (and a warning to 'bite carefully' from the kid at the table), I nibbled the edges and had no more accidents but remained the subject of teasing sexy jokes throughout the evening. 

Hubby had the Dead Ringer, loaded with beef brisket, BBQ sauce, jack cheese and an onion ring. He loved it, but the stacked meat on meat was too much for me. 

Heads up:  the burgers are huge. I could barely finish mine and probably shouldn't have. Think I'll split one with hubby next time or skip the shake. 

Here's how the menu works:

Step One, pick your patty:  beef, turkey, veggie, Portobello mushroom or chicken breast. Elk is +$3.39. 

Step Two, topping combo:  60 choices!  Sections include Faves, Born to be Wild, Gettin Saucy, Cuz we Like it Hot, Carnivore's Corner, Veg Out, World Tour.

Step Three, choose a side:  fries, broccoli, celery, cucumbers, weeds, sweet potato fries, spicy chips, mashed, slaw.

Step Four, bun: white, wheat, gluten-free.

Step Five, add-ons (crispy dills, Kraft Dinner, etc.).

Then waited over an HOUR for our food - there were no more than 20 guests/7-10 occupied in the entire place, several of whom were already eating. When the food did come it was lukewarm. Our lettuce was red and brown around the edges. The (cold) poutine gravy was powdery and several of our (cold) fries had a powdery substance on them that I assume was pure gravy powder. Both of our water glasses (measuring cups) were dirty and had clear dirt marks. (And, not food related, but the women's washroom was absolutely disgusting - I could barely walk in due to the smell of vomit) I have been to The Works once or twice before and had a good experience, but I am honestly so disgusted with the wait times and poor food quality on this visit that I doubt I will return. I really wish I could blame this one bad experience on \"dinner rush\", but the restaurant was not busy at ALL - simply no justification and I am totally at a loss as to how our food could possibly have taken over an hour, and turned out so badly.",0,0,0,"KW4y7uDGjVfU3ClkEjIGhg","34YkLIE8M00ZoiR2IML0qg"

While the food was really good, my visits there will be very limited if not non-existent because of the pricing.

I don't remember the name of my burger the first time around, but I do remember it had eggplant and pesto in it. The flavour was superb and it is something I would eat again, though ... Without the burger meat. Just like the first time, my second time around the burger meat was really dry and bland.

I don't really know what The Works is considered but I assume gourmet burger place? 

First time I came here, I was so-so about it, so I thought to myself, \"Okay, I'll give it a second chance.\" There will be no third.

The Works is a really big disappointment to me and it's extremely bittersweet because they do have some flavour combinations that really do work and are spot on, but the proteins, I don't know how they manage to screw it up all the time. I've never come alone here and even my other table mates have said the burger is just dry but they enjoy the flavour.

Really unique place though, down to their serving glasses in measuring cups to the extensive menu with a staff member up and ready to walk you through it as it really can be overwhelming. But whoever said a little customization isn't a good thing right? That is something I do commend them on.

There's nothing I want more than this place to succeed, but until they can get their cooking times right on their proteins, I don't see myself coming here in the near future. Maybe if they're still in business 2 or 3 years down the road, I might consider returning and updating my review.",1,1,0,"KW4y7uDGjVfU3ClkEjIGhg","SML6__mXgEbA4DZkVchruA"

I order the crispy chicken burger, the only thing i ever get at this spot, and my friend orders a side of salad with NO bacon. I get the chicken burger and it tastes nothing like it usually does.. tastes more fishy and bland than crispy spicy chicken. I have barely 3 bites and leave the rest. My friend is halfway through her salad when she notices bits of bacon. Wtf? We call the server over and mention that we said NO bacon on the salad and then i ask him why my chicken burger tastes like fish and is not spicy AT ALL and he says he is positive its chicken.... 10 minutes later the manager passes by to tell us that dessert is on the house and he will not charge me for the burger (which i appreciate. I just wish i was able to enjoy a good meal after a long day at work). My friend orders her free dessert (donuts), and then the server comes by 10 minutes later to inform us that they actually ran out of donuts.

So we want to Milestones on a Thursday evening and once we arrived there were no more tables available in the patio. We dined in the dining room. Our server who we won't name, wasn't that great of a server, not to us anyways. We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking. 

As for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate.

Have always had surprisingly good service and food at the Yorkdale location, so we thought we'd try the Richmond Hill location while in the area. It was a flop.
The server asked if we had any food allergies and I noted that I did not want any raw onions. She laughed, presumably because it's so obvious that fish and chips would not run the risk of onion contamination. 
Husband ordered a salad with some kind of chicken on it. 
Drinks were good - they had that fancy Walter's Caesar mix on offer (it was roughly brunch time) and I had a really nice craft brew IPA. 
Husband's salad came with avocado. The avocado was rock hard. Whoever made the salad and struggled to slice the avocado would have known it was not ripe. A shame they tried to pass it off. He asked for a ripe one instead and the salad was brought back with edible avocado. Great.
My fish and chips were nothing to write home about. The fries were good (a little on the sweet side - maybe Yukon gold? -  I like them that way. The fish was lame. And, of course, it came with a coleslaw that was alive with onion. Bursting at the seams with the stuff. When the server came to check on us, my plate had the ridiculously large pile of picked-out onion on it and we said \"remember the whole \"no onions\" thing?\". She laughed. 
When the bill came with no amendments, I asked if they hadn't planned to make up for the errors. She spoke to the manager and got us a whopping 5 bucks off our 80 dollar meal.

I went here for brunch with a friend and had a feeling service would be bad from the beginning, when we didn't see our waitress for at least 15 minutes after we received our waters.

When we told her our food orders, before the waitress walked away, I asked my friend if she wanted a tea or coffee to go with her breakfast.....(why am I thinking of this?)

I would have ordered a tea, but the waitress left as if our table was on fire!

My friend and I asked for separate checks, and the dummy switched our two totals around, which my friend innocently paid for MY receipt.

When it came time for me to pay, I pointed out the error to the waitress, who just stood there with a blank look on her face.

I asked if its possible to reverse it.

Well that question must have offended her greatly, because she GRABBED THE TRANSACTION MACHINE ABRUPTLY FROM MY HAND,  mumbled something out of her breath and STOMPED AWAY, SHAKING HER HEAD.

Shortly after a heavy set gentleman (I assume the manager), told us the complications of reversing it, but we told him to void it anyways.

I told the man OUR WAITRESS WAS CLEARLY IRRITATED (although it was HER mistake...).

He was very polite, and it worked out in my favour because I LEFT HER ZERO TIP (I promise you, I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE).

I'm out of town, but if in an unlikely situation I ate there again I MEMORIZED HER NAME and would REQUEST NOT TO BE PUT IN HER SECTION.

By the time you have a few beers and a small meal, you are out $60-all in.  I was out over a Benji tonight as my bud flipped for the bill - I lost.  LOL.

I'd tell you what I had for dinner but I can't.  The meals are so the same that there is nothing to remember it by.

For those who like to drink as the sun beats down on you, the patio should be open soon.  It is southerly exposed and nicely arranged.  Do remember though that the patio is next to a bridge that overpasses the train to the east of the restaurant.  Lots of traffic, exhaust fumes, dust (from the constant construction in the area), and noise.  It is however a great place to hang after hours.

First off, I don't usually like Milestones. I was never a fan of their food. Having finished work, we went there for some food. They lost a star because of the appetizer. It was the dip and the chips tasted like it was handled by sweaty hands. Not my favorite dish..... the dip was pretty good though. 

We ordered the meatloaf and the steak. The steak was nothing to write home about. What can i say, steak is steak. Unless it is an amazing cut, it all taste the same. The baked potato was a little bland because they just added green onions and sour cream. Other places, they would add things like bacon bits, or butter, but not this place....second lost star

The meatloaf was pretty good. It was a little spiced, but not too spicy. everyone enjoyed it. 

Overall, the price and the service was pretty good. A dinner for 4 ran just over $100. They have a special on Wed where couples dine for $50 and it includes 1 appetizer, 2 course, and 1 desert. Overall a good value.

A quick update to my previous review.

Milestone customer service contacted me through yelp messaging and requested me to call back so that they can \"make it right\". I made the call and wanted to see what they had to offer. Spoke to a CSR and after providing a whole bunch of personal information, she said that she will need to forward that information to someone else who will call me and request more information on my experience. This first call took about 15 minutes. At the end of the call I asked what they would eventually offer and the CSR lady said that if my story checks out then they may give me a $10 gift card.

Told the CSR that I was no longer interested in taking this any further. 

Not worth my time and trouble just for the possibility of getting a $10 gift card at Milestone, where I will not be visiting again anytime soon.

We arrived at the resturant at 5pm, and it was fairly quiet. Ordered the 12 oz, and was told the rarest possible cut was medium - medium rare.  And mash potatoes are not available. This seems very strange to me why a resturant that's known to serve good quality prime rib would not have any medium rare available.  The explanation from our server was it was sold out and it takes 12 hours to make it.  My initial guess was the new prime rib has not finished cooking, so I asked our server to ask the kitchen if my assumption was correct.  I also mentioned I would wait for the new prime rib, if possible.  Unfortunately the response was negative. So i had to go ahead with the order.

The dish arrived and the cut looks like it's been under the heater for many hours.  And appears to be well done.  Refer to photos. 

This leads me one of the following two assumptions.

1.  The prime rib available at 5pm was left over from yesterday, from under the meat heater or oven for so long.  Of course it's well done.  But I am doubting why a well known national chain would do that. This will just hurt their reputation.  So this makes me come to the 2nd assumption.

2.  The machine or oven to cook the prime rib for 12 is malfunctioning.  Hence over cooking the prime rib.

When our server came up and asked how our food was, it is obvious the prime rib was not done right.  So he informed me that he is going to call the manager.  

While I was writing up the yelp review, going to give it an one star. The manager came to our table and sincerely apologized.  She was very kind and sincere with a fresh dish of prime rib in her hands.  Too bad I don't have an infinite appetite. 2nd Prime rib is pink in color and appears to be medium rare. See photos.  

She explained the cook cut the incorrect side of the prime rib, hence being well done the first try.  She also mentioned the mash potato is now available and would offer some. 

To conclude, I will not comment on how the well done entree tasted like.  The 2nd attempt looked good; but in comparison, Keg still had the edge.

When we left the restaurant, the manager offered us some free apps for our next visit.  With all the above in mind, I've decided to add one more star to my initial review.",1,0,0,"reWc1g65PNZnKz_Ub9QKOQ","K86nuyuxpmPl_t2V-H6syg"

They food offerings were pretty much the same as the original location, but at this location they added combo menu, which includes one of their famous dishes, bubble tea, pudding and fruit. I got the minced pork and sausage combo and my husband got the popcorn chicken combo. The taste was same as the original location, it was delicious and the portions were​ also the same size.

Other than the food, we shared a can of apple cider. All in all, with the discount, it was $10 per person..tax and tips included. Food wise: taste and quality are exactly the same as the original location. I am so glad they kept the consistency. Could have ordered more but could only eat so much. Definitely can't wait to go back and order more of my favourite items from Papa Chang.

 This location has about 24 seats and is definitely more comfortable and colourful than the one on 16th  It feels definitely more relax and enjoyable and u don't feel as stressed.

How much do I love Papa Chang? well, I once waited 35+ mins for a table for two and once we placed the order, we waited another 45 minutes for the food..  I WAS SO STARVING AT THAT TIME... This is how much I loved that place. Since then, the food comes out super fast.


Papa Chang is the #1 Best Taiwanese food in town!!! There is no comparison between other places that offer Taiwanese food. I am quite mesmerized by their vast selection of food items. I think I tried almost everything on their menu.

People complained about how far it is and how small the place it.. well, now they can't complain anymore since there is another franchise in town and the restaurant is much bigger in size. 


I highly recommend this restaurant and to anyone visiting Toronto!!! :D  A MUST TRY!!

Congrats on the new location Papa Chang's",5,3,4,"L1XHTn7S-6har9UGAPjcWQ","s_SzQvkDfn18Cquma7DndQ"

As another reviewer stated, they nickel and dime you for everything. I ordered the combo meal with hot wings and when I asked for celery the waitress said \"those don't come with the combo meals and will be $2.99 extra.\" Really? For 5 celery sticks? My fiance ordered the ranch wings and they came out plain with what appeared to be a dry seasoning. They apologized for the mixup and brought him ranch wings but only one drumstick in the entire batch.

The thing I love about this location, is the Biker Rally that takes place weekly...you have got to see it to believe it. Truly amazing. 

The staff is always courteous and quick to help you. The menu has just about everything you could want on it, but the wings are a must! From the tame BBQ sauce to the \"Atomic Wings Challenge\" (as seen on Man vs. Food, and you must sign a waiver before even tasting one wing) the sauces are top-notch. My personal favorite is the Arizona Ranch.

If you ever come across one of these restaurants, you need to stop in...I look forward to any business trip I make where there is a QS&L...especially to Middleton, Wisconsin where I had my first taste of the best wings on earth.",0,0,0,"PV9CdNFDOX4_zWm3Sy3W8g","SMj4mrfY8fIOWhI79MgLQQ"

More importantly, the food was terrible. We ordered nachos, onion rings, and pretzels for our table. The nachos were completely tasteless. The corn they throw on top of the chips says it's fire-grilled on the menu, but it's just out of a can. There's no real cheese on the dish and the queso they use instead is pretty boring. The pretzels and the onion rings were acceptable except for the sauces that came with them. The cheese sauce that came with the pretzels was different from the cheese sauce on the nachos. It had a disgusting skin on it when it got to the table, it was a yucky, goop-y consistency, and it wasn't very good. I don't remember what they called the sauce that came with the onion rings - something tomato based. We just dipped the rings in ketchup instead.

C.R. had the Atomic wings. They actually make you sign a waiver before they will put in an order. They were hot, but nothing too severe. 
I had 10 of the Regular Hot wings. They were awesome. They were served with a generous helping of Celery and Blue Cheese. 
The service was wonderful, the decor was a NASCAR lovers dream. There was actually a exact Model of a Rusty Wallace car that was suspended over the Bar. 
My only complaint is that the Middleton, Wisconsin location is the closest one to Chicago. If they ever opened a location here, they would make a killing. It would blow any wing place in Chicago out of the water.

It was pretty empty, but it was the day after Christmas. People still were in family mode and staying in from what I could tell.

I was excited to order some boneless wings, nothing like knowing what you want before you go in! I tried a Custom Built Combo - Loaded Magna Fries and 6 pack of wings (original BBQ) and six more wings with Dusted Chipotle BBQ. I don't typically order dry rubs for wings or ribs (I know that's a popular Southern way). When they came out, the 'dusted' wings were hands down my favorite. I will go back again just to have those wings in that dusting.

The fries were good, initially, but as I got the remaining fries at the bottom, they became dry and less enjoyable. The service felt under-attentive, knowing how empty the place was, we were surprised to hear their trivia consoles were all out. We also sat waiting for refills a little long - especially after he came and asked if we wanted refills.

When I got to my second to last wing, I thought 'wow, this is a big wing!' ...it wasn't a wing. In fact, I had no idea what it was (at the time). First bite - not a wing. Second bite - nothing but pepper (spit into napkin). I pointed it out to the waiter, not because I wanted something free or a new meal (I was full and got my money's worth). But I was really curious what it was.

As we were getting up to leave the manager rushed out with a free 6 pack of wings as an apology (again, not what I needed, but it was well welcomed). Turns out it was breading... nothing but breading. Yeah, that explains what I tasted. He had also never seen that happen before - so don't worry - it shouldn't happen to you.

Overall, a great gimmick restaurant with the play on their name and the decor in each location. I won't be going out of my way to visit the Middleton location again, but the downtown Madison location is a great spot.

Quaker Steak & Lube does perfectly crisp skin, and the quality of their chicken is good. Not the best quality I've had, but not bad by any means. Their sauces are tasty, but their scale of hot is a little bit off I think. Their ranch for dipping is good, but still not as good as Hooters.  I LOVE their beer sizes! At other places I have to end up ordering a few but here I can just order one huge beer! The service has always been great, prompt, thorough, and polite. The server always brings wipes right away so you don't have to ask for such an obvious thing. You get Twizzlers with the bill :)

The menu is mainly sandwiches, steaks and wings with salads, other sandwiches and sides in the mix.  There is ideally a good choice for anyone in your family.  

Our service was very quick and polite, but you also walk past some arcade games and claw machines sporting some prizes in there your competitive family member might want.

The bucket 'o wings was tasty, the wings were larger than other similar places, and the sauces were better too.  Over the years though, I've visited several more times and the quality is steadily decreasing.  The wings seem smaller and the sauces more bland.  And sometimes they are slimy rather than crispy.  Bad.  All of the rest of the food is typical, so if the wings aren't special there's not much to differentiate from any other restaurant in the category.

The service has become borderline terrible.  The tables are often dirty. Their staff take a long time to get back to the table, and don't check in very often.  This is a big place; if your server doesn't come back you are pretty much out of luck if you have a request.

For that matter, the whole restaurant is good.  Plus they have a car mounted sideways on the wall.  Seriously.  It's solidly hung too.  I checked.  It's not going anywhere.

What I appreciate is unlike other wing-establishments of their kind, their sauce names actually line up to their heat.  If you order a medium hot sauce, it's not mild nor hot.  Their Arizona Ranch sauce is a spectacular mix of medium-ish sauce with ranch dressing.  

For entrees, I'm a fan of the wrap and my wife has actually gotten the steak a couple of times.  She was pleased.

The server dropped off the food, but no napkins and no utensils. I had to go to the front to ask for them. My burger came with about six fries. Hello? Fries are CHEAP, so why scrimp there? She never came back to refill drinks. When she asked if we wanted dessert, I had to point out that the kids meals come with popsicles, to which she said \"oh\". When the server came back with my change, there was no receipt, and the change was $2 short, so who knows if she even rang it up. 

The food was pretty cold too.

Their chicken wings are just as good (if not better) as Buffalo Wild Wings' wings. I tried the Arizona Ranch and the Medium wings and they were both pretty delicious. A small order comes with ~10 wings or so ($.99 upcharge for getting two flavors was kind of a bummer) but the wings are pretty large, so that was more than enough to fill me. The service was considerably slower, but I was warned about this due to it being trivia night.

They also have an AYCE wing special on Tuesday evenings I believe! I've heard that that's pretty delicious and definitely a good deal if you can eat a lot.

The actual restaurant is a pretty cool establishment! I heard that it's called Quaker Steak & Lube because people used to get their car serviced here while eating a meal, hence the Steak & Lube part. It's quite a bit larger than I expected from a restaurant like this, and I really liked the neon green lights all over the building. It's a pretty hard place to miss if you're passing by at night.

I will note that the waiter never refilled any of my party's water throughout the whole night. This is probably cause of trivia, but still...it was kind of annoying to continuously ask the bar for more water.",2,1,1,"PV9CdNFDOX4_zWm3Sy3W8g","1uYygtl6SRdAtj2NR7nV8Q"

The answer would be the extremely slow service. 

It is near impossible have lunch here during the a weekday if you're on any sort of schedule. We've tried that, several times.

There's not a lack of wait staff. That's the easy part. It takes no time at all to get your drinks ordered. It takes no time at all to place your order.

Just wait for the food to come. Then wait. Then wait some more. The kitchen runs at a snail's pace.

The strange thing is, on weekends or in the evening, this isn't a problem. And , that's what gets me. On a weekend, I can take my time. For dinner, I can take my time. 

For a weekday lunch, it is honestly better to find somewhere else, unless you don't have to be back at work anytime soon.

 Having been moderately disappointed with the last few times I've ordered \"hot\" wings I was intrigued when I saw that they claimed the best wings and also had a triple atomic challenge. I was a bit suprised at the cost to attempt the challenge (13.99 for three wings and a t-shirt if you succeed) so I opted to just order their all you can eat special and maybe get a few towards the end to see what they were like. So after a few orders of variously spicy wings I ended up at the level just below the atomic. At that point we had a bit of debate at the table which ended up with my skipping the atomic and going right to triple atomic.

 The waitperson let me know that there was an additional charge which was fine and he provided me with a waiver to sign. With the \"legal\" formalities out of they way they brought out my last order of wings with the triple atomic sauce, and  they even threw in a bonus wing! With a small amount of trepidation, I sniffed the sauce for the telltale chemical odor of capsaicin extract which can give you some pretty nasty chemical burns. It seemed to be ok so while everyone stared, I dug in, carefully avoiding my lips. Finished the first and waited a bit for it to sink in... not bad! Good slow build on the burn and a LOT of complex flavors. It was apparent that whomever developed the recipe was a spicy food lover as well. I finished the rest of the wings and settled back to enjoy the endorphin rush. 

I even got a little bit in a togo cup for a fellow chili head back home. Wonder what TSA will have to say about that? Hope no drug sniffing dogs are injured in the the process.

What quaker Steak lacks in class, consistency, quality, and value it more than makes up for in gluttony.  

The Big Deal:
All you can eat wings for around 13 dollars is a weekly ritual that I only somewhat begrudgingly keep up Tuesday nights.  The format is you get 4 wings at a time which surprisingly come out not at the snails pace of a normal all-you-can-eat game but at a decent pace.  Long Islands are 3$ and service is pretty quickl

My favorite:
Get supercharged wings.  They are absolutely delicious, even if after 4 I wind up crying they are still so tasty.  For the more faint of heart you gotta try Haute Parm.

Shortfalls:
Sometimes they serve you wings that are too dry or are overcooked but the next four are usually better.  The Long islands aren't as strong as good ones, but hey, it's not like the Lube is a Gay Bar (which by the way is the least apparaently true statement I've ever made). The huge hordes of high school jocks hitting on the food runners only heat the blood without boiling it.  I love hate this place.

It is a total dude place, as the decor is car themed, but I love coming here. We always have a great time, and their specials are ever-changing. I have been here for AYCE, wing nights, and Bike nights. Each one is a unique and fun experience.

We used to go to the Quaker downtown as we could walk there, but we love the wings here so much that we drive out to Middleton regularly. The sauces are always being updated, but I would definitely recommend: Parmesan garlic, Arizona ranch, and any of the dry rubs. Their ranch is DELICIOUS. And their burgers are yummy, too! I have had the mac and cheese burger (good) and the jalapeno burger (AMAZING). I suggest you try the apps, as they are always a good match to beer at the bar.

My wife ordered the lube burger which had a pretty nice sauce and was a good size along with a side of boneless Fiery BBQ wings which were not spicy at all (it's in the 'yellow' so she was expecting at least a tiny hint) and too heavily breaded.

For some strange reason I had an overwhelming need to dip something in ranch (no this is not a common occurrence), specifically chicken tenders. Lo and behold when I opened up the menu they were advertising what appeared to be a revamped chicken tender. 

So away I sent the waiter with that order and a side of medium sauced buffalo wings. When the tenders came I was shocked by the teeny weeny tiny portion. It looked like a kid's meal portion so I was quite happy to have the extra wings. The quantity not withstanding, they had good flavor, were very moist as was advertised, and went well with both the Boom Boom sauce and ranch. My dunking desire was mostly satisfied.

My family and I moved to West Madison in January of 2009, leaving our favorite italian restaurant behind back in our hometown. We were searching for a place to go *once a week for family night* and we found it immediately! 

Quaker Steak and Lube was recommended to my brother by a co-worker. So, one Saturday night, right before hitting up The Comedy Club on State, we decided to stop by Quaker Steak and Lube as a \"trial\". We were immediately greeted and seated with no wait. It was BUSY too. I ordered the chicken fenders and french fries with a side of ranch- they were delicious! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The fries were seasoned to perfection and the ranch... YUM. It's hard to find a place that serves really great ranch. **So far Red Robin is #1 ranch server and Quaker Steak and Lube is now #2** My fiance ordered chicken wings. They tasted baked and then deep-fried. Their choice of sauces were practically limitless. There was a ton to choose from. My brother and his wife each ordered a burger and fries and a bowl of the cheesy baked potato soup. They were both very pleased with their meal. Our bill came to about $60 which wasn't bad for the four of us. We had a great time and the place is decorated so that even if you went with someone you didn't like, you'd have plenty of things to keep yourself busy staring at.

Overall, I highly recommend Quaker Steak and Lube to anyone looking for a great meal in a fun & friendly atmosphere.

However, this is not the place to take someone to romantically gaze into each others eyes. It's quite noisy and very laid back.

We sat there waiting another 20 min or so for the food, again it was fairly sparse in there.  When the food finally came out, I was given the wrong salad.  The guy who brought the food out was very nice and apologetic about the screw up and said he'd get order the salad for me right away.  Its now 2pm and I'm feeling light headed after the long wait so I asked him if I could have a couple of pieces of chicken from the other salad since I had to wait.  He was very accommodating and left the entire wrong salad saying we could have as much of it as we like since it would be thrown out anyway.  A few min later the waitress that took the order comes out and also apologizes about the wrong salad and proceeds to take it away, I told her what the other guy said and practically had to pry the salad away from her - I've had like 1 piece of chicken at that point.  The waitress then comes back with a side dish containing what should have been on the salad I actually ordered with the intent of dumping it on top of the gross ice berg lettuce which I don't eat.

The customer service was abysmal.  We walk in and ask to be seated outside, as it was a beautiful day.  We were told its first come/first serve and walk ourselves out there.  We found many empty tables, but had to search for one that didn't have crumbs on it.  They were bussed, but just not very well.  We sat there for about 10 minutes...no one has even acknowledged us.  There was a waitress who has been by the table next to us several time, but never said anything to us.  Then the bartender comes over to us and brings us menus and takes our drink order.  About ten minutes later he asks if we wanted to order food.  There were bugs (fruit fly size) flying around...and after my husband pulled several out of his beer...he looked down and had 4 more in there.  We decide we'd rather sit inside.  My husband walks over to the bar tender and requests a table inside.  The bar tender turns to someone who looks like she may be a manager and she directs us to talk to the hostess to be seated inside.  The person who was bringing our food out hears this and offers to find a table for us.  We are seated and our food is delivered.  They were nice enough to split the burger and onion rings for us, but the burger was just above room temperature.  It was still yummy, just would have liked it to be warm and hot off the grill.   Maybe I expected too much.  The onion rings were very good...the wings were decent.  If it weren't for the terrible service, we would have definitely given it another shot.  Every single employee in that restaurant looked very unhappy.  No smiles at all.  Nobody was friendly.  It was kinda depressing.

I had the wedge salad. The lettuce was nice crunchy iceberg. Not super green but I think that's iceberg lettuce for ya. You can choose grilled or fried chicken and I opted for the grilled.

The good:
- This place is amazing (very detailed good thing, right?)
- They have decent taps - Sapporo, Welly Dark and the regular stuff
- There is live music on Fridays and Celtic dancing on Mondays
- There are 2 dart boards but there isn't enough room to play darts
- The restrooms are individual rooms and SUPER clean
- 6$ even for a pint of Welly

The bad:
- There is a sketchy step on the way to the restroom
- No music was playing when we walked in and no one was talking - it was just a bunch of people drinking and staring at me
- I felt a little weird being... not Irish

How much variation (good or bad) can you possibly introduce into egg drop soup, fried rice, and egg rolls?  Szechuan Cuisine was no exception, although I'd put it towards the upper end of that tight range.

The place was absolutely empty on Friday around noon.  The dining room was clean, and the lighting was bright.  The Chinese zodiac place mats were right out of central casting.  (Good to know that I'm still a snake.)  There was an unusually large number of lunch combos, and they even made \"Chicken & Broccoli\" into a combo for my friend.  (His tastes aren't very exotic.)

$6 got me the Szechuan Chicken combo.  The egg drop soup was below average, without tofu or many vegetables.  The chicken dish was pretty typical, although you don't get to eat \"wood ear\" every day.  The egg roll was solid, and the steamed rice was perfectly cooked and unusually tasty.  The one unique thing about my meal was the salad alongside the entree.  The raw cabbage was a pleasant textural change, but the spicy, fish-flavored dressing didn't work for me.

To sum up, Szechuan Cusine's lunch combos offer good variety, good portions, and good value, but nothing spectacular.

Water boiled fish was pretty good, not all that numbing compare to other restaurant, so it's good on my book, soup is pretty decent too.

I was in a seafood type of mood, and the waiter suggested the Water Boiled Fish (Shuizhuyu).  I've never had this dish before, but I do like spicy foods, and I was not disappointed!  It was very flavorful, with a spicy tongue-numbing oil/sauce, and the fish (boneless chunks) was very tender and had a nice delicate flavor to balance out the bold taste of the sauce.  We also had some family style tofu (Which is not vegetarian, as it comes with slices of pork), and Szechuan chicken.  Although the other two dishes tasted good, and were seasoned well, the real standout of our meal was the fish.  Our total for the 3 dishes was about $30 including tax, and our meal came with 2 cartons of white rice.

They have daily specials on a whiteboard, but you have to know how to read Chinese to be able to know what they are.

"B5OD1tZ8ojYKqQ_NRpIxig",5,"2012-04-17 00:00:00","We had dinner at Szechuan Cuisine on Easter with a good friend of ours from San Francisco.   We ordered the dumplings in chili oil from the dim sum menu as an appetizer, and for dinner we ordered water boiled fish, ChonQing spicy chicken, and chicken with jalapenos for dinner.   We were not disappointed.   

Chongqing Spicy Chicken  ( ) is the signature Sichuan dish in China. You go for Sichuan anywhere in China and you will see this dish on each and every table.  The ChongQing Chicken at Szechuan Cuisine is as good and as authentic as what you can expect in mainland China.  ChongQing Spicy Chicken ($9.95) consists of little nuggets of bone-in chicken stir-fried with a very thin, very crispy corn starch crust, then stir fried again with handfuls of red chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorns.  This dish is the best in the Valley.

The water-boiled fish ($10.95) arrived in a large soup bowl and was even better than our last visit.  This dish arrives with a generous garnish of fresh cilantro to contrast the deep red of the chili oil for a dramatic presentation.  

The dumplings in chili oil were made from scratch - and filled with a generous portions of tender pork and just the right amount of garlic.  There were eight (8) dumplings in the order ($4.95) - and we ended up taking four dumplings home.  We had them cold for lunch on Monday and they were still fresh and tender.

Our guest had never experienced authentic Sichuan dishes and she was amazed and delighted at how flavorful the dishes were.  The service was excellent - as it was on our previous visit.

Paul, one of the restaurant's new owners, came over to our table to introduce himself to our party.  He suggested we try one of the items from the new daily Chinese specials menu next time.  

It is so nice to discover new restaurants serving fresh, made from scratch, authentic food with care here in the East Valley.

We ordered cashew chicken, kung pao chicken and house fried rice. The two chicken dishes were pretty much the same except the kung pao had a slight kick to it. But otherwise, neither had any flavor. I had to use soy sauce to get flavor. The fried rice was fine, but nothing special. We were really hopeful for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant, but so far, this isn't it. Something no one else mentioned is that they don't yet have a liquor license, so no alcohol is available (and on this night, no lemonade either).

"Fkp4JIwprXu0D3iCwtTwQg",4,"2012-06-24 00:00:00","Ever since I had one of the best meals of my life in a little Szechuan place in SF's Chinatown, I've been looking for a similar experience here in Phoenix.  I think I just found it.

I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign and finally got to try it tonight.  As I walked in, there was a whiteboard menu at the door entirely in Chinese (good sign).  As my wife and I sat down, we noticed we were the only \"gringos\" in the place (another good sign).

The menu was massive, but fortunately, thanks to Yelp, I knew they had what they called water boiled fish, which in SF they called fish in chili oil.  I ordered it while my wife ordered orange chicken and some potstickers.

The potstickers and orange chicken came out quickly and at the same time.  The pot stickers were crispy outside, juicy inside, but there was a sizable pool of oil in the bottom of the dish.  I think they need to drain them better.

The orange chicken was battered and fried in a neon orange sauce.  It was also stone cold.  We quickly got the waitress' attention and she quickly took it away and promised to make us another one.

A few minutes later, they brought out another orange chicken and the water boiled fish.  The chicken was hot (this time) and crispy, but the sauce was overly sweet.  Pretty average although the portion was more than generous.

The fish, on the other hand, was phenomenal.  Perfectly poached talapia fillets in a spicy chili oil broth with cabbage, onions, and peppers.  The fish literally melted in my mouth.  It was every bit as good as what I had at Z&Y in SF.  This was the dish I was looking for ever since that trip.

My wife, upon tasting the fish, decided I had made the better order and offered to trade but it didn't matter because, despite being just $10.95, the bowl is more than enough for 2 people.

Overall my impression (based on my experience and other reviews) is that this restaurant is kind of leading a \"double life\".  The front of the menu is \"American friendly\", consisting of somewhat generic versions of familiar dishes, while the back is the \"real menu\" with great authentic Szechuan dishes.

I expected to be disappointed, but came out full to the brim on my one and only famous Szechuan dish, Water-Boiled Fish.  

Although initially it seemed to lack salt, but with each bite it got better and then subtle yet lovely tongue numbing which I love was present before and came into full focus with a sip of ice cold water.......\"Ahhh!  I love this dish\"  Although the dish cost more here it is quite bigger than the one I get at Szechuan Garden.  

Szechuan Cuisine does pretty well with it.  Hopefully, they don't get shy with the mouth numbing herb.  It makes the dish so good.

Let me stipulate that I am an American Born Chinese, however I fatten up every time I go visit my Grandparents in Taiwan, because the food is sooo good, and my dad is very picky about the Chinese food he introduces to me here in the US, therefore I am very picky about my Chinese restaurants that I go to. 

If you want egg rolls, kung pao chicken, fried rice, or won-ton soup you're better off getting your taste worth at a Panda Express!

But if you're looking for the real deal!  We're talking about correctly spiced Restaurant Szechuan style food this is the place to be.  I just had the water boiled fish, and it reminded me of this great place that my dad takes me too, and their Chung Spicy Shrimp is fried and spiced to perfection.  My parents have taught me that real Szechuan (Sichuan) food has very hard to come by spices, and these dishes carry them.  Like the fire flower pepper that isn't even spicy, but give this beautiful tasting numbness to the tongue! To end the delight of this explosion of tastes and to help quell the June heat we finished off with Mei Mei ice: shaved ice with sweetened condensed milk and Chinese green legumes.  

This is definitely a place to come back to!  One tip, the beginning of the menu starts with all the Americanized Chinese foods that everyone is used to IE sweet and sour chicken, General Tso's .., go towards the back of the menu and you'll find the Authentic Szechuan menu, and you will not be disappointed.

Also if you don't know what to order, the restaurant has decorated the wall with pictures of the Authentic Szechuan dishes with English labels on the wall to inspire your adventurous taste buds!

One more thing I've learned is that don't expect great tasting Chinese restaurants to be clean or have great service.  However this place is new and  it was absolutely pristine including the (women's) bathrooms.  Since I came after lunch time the service was fine in my opinion, up to typical American (and better than the rude Jersey) standards. Also as another side note (reading another restaurant review) all Chinese Restaurants typically are FAMILY STYLE, meaning you don't eat one dish and only one dish, you SHARE! So if one dish comes out one at a time, it doesn't constitute bad service!

"Erm1ZcdrxHhWUlftXyzhyw",5,"2013-08-24 00:00:00","I'm not opposed to higher prices. In my opinion, you get what you pay for. High prices keep the riff raff away and you won't witness meatheads trying to pick fights or be obnoxiously loud here. If you are looking for a lot of cheap food, go elsewhere, there are plenty of hole in the wall sports bars in the area to serve you.  It's nice to have a more upscale sports bar in the area. The area has needed an upscale sports bar for a long time. Nabers provides great service with a very personal touch. 

I would request the following from the owners if they really want to make this a special place. 

-Be loyal to the local teams. Show ASU, U of A, Cardinals, Coyotes, D-Backs and Suns games. You would be surprised how you can walk into a sports bar and not find the local game on. To make matters worse, the staff will be rude to you if you ask them to put the local game on. Don't be the typical Arizona bar that leaves the channel on ESPN 2 displaying World Poker Tour instead of the D-backs game or the Coyotes game. 

- Provide fast and reliable Wi-Fi. A lot of fantasy football watchers require it. 

-Offer valet service on NFL Sundays during football season. Parking can be a pain during this time and the option to drop off your car and walk in is a nice luxury

- Offer a VIP room on football afternoons and special sporting events for die hard fans who are willing to pay more for more personal and accessible service. 

-Consider offering an online reservation ability where you can reserve, schedule and select your table during football Sundays when it is really busy for an additional fee of course. 

- Secure the parking lot or have a parking lot attendant. A lot of fights, hazing and vandalism occur at night. People are less likely to do this if the parking lot is supervised.

-Know your customers on a personal level and remember their names. Call them by their respective titles unless they tell you otherwise",3,1,0,"1AxEmgv8Dsr3iU9Aa40jPw","79uQM6mAgJJcmYRtMO_u1Q"

Second, our food was not good at all. We'd been wanting to try Naber's for quite some time and the reviews seemed promising. I got the \"brat sliders\" which were very thin and dry burger patties with some spicy aioli sloppily thrown on them. The buns were way too big for such tiny servings of meat.

I'm still feeling sick from my nasty burger. I think the cook may have lost the lid off salt shaker-- each bite was like licking a block of salt and trust me, I like things salty. The service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our group of eight arrived together and we were seated right away. 2 people in our group got their food right away and the rest of us waited 45 minutes and we only ordered burgers. 

My burger was disgusting! I ordered the one with the bacon, over easy egg and onion strings. The egg was like a rubber disk and the yolk was hard! It was way too salty for even me to eat. We didn't complain and still they realized how they screwed us over. Four of us didn't even take more than 2 -3 bites because it was so gross (and we're not snobs). They only offered us one free dessert for the whole table! 

They should have had the manager come to apologize and comped the meals that took forever and given us all dessert, at least that's what I would've done.

From the outside the restaurant looks very nice, however the empty parking lot should have been a sign to eat somewhere else. On the inside the booth we were placed in had multiple rips in the seat. Not what I was expecting from a newly renovated restaurant in the food area of West Chandler. 

Next was the menu. My wife and I ordered the grilled hotwings, better than moms meatloaf, and a burger and a couple of beers. Simple barfood right? Our tab was almost $60.00 including a standard tip. The staff was appropriately dressed and was professional. 

Lets start with the appetizer. The hot wings were on the small side, even though they were advertised as being large and you only got 6 wings. The presentation was very nice, however I am in a bar and was not expecting great presentation. I was expecting value, which I did not receive paying more than $1.00/ wing.

Next the entree.... The better than moms meatloaf was $17.00!. I ordered it anyway since my mom made some incredible meatloaf and wanted to see what the offering was. GREATLY Disappointed. The meatloaf came in 2 pieces and was very small. The meat was topped with an inedible garnish, but it was everywhere so it impossible for you not to get some of it in your mouth. Mashed potatoes were good and so were the steamed vegetables. Their mom had to be a horrible cook because i would not consider it better than the fare my mom served on Thursdays. 

My wife's meal was a little better, but how can you really mess up a hamburger. The fries had a funny taste to them, as if they were making funnel cake in the same oil... 

Overall I left the place feeling I got ripped off. I can order a prime rib less than 1/4 mile away at Longhorn or Charlestons for the same money, or for a few dollars more I could go to Flemings or Roys. Needless to say we wont be back.",4,2,1,"1AxEmgv8Dsr3iU9Aa40jPw","_dj52KJptVB9Sk7Hq9XO1g"

They have this giant bacon burger with bacon in and on top of the burger patty. It has a fried egg on it as well. It was the bomb. It was huge, like a child's head.

Staff seems pretty fun, a little weird but that's OK. I'm weird too. The prices were a little high, with three of us spending close to $90 on three meals, one appetizer, and a few drinks. To be fair though, we went with entrées and not the lunch specials. Those were six dollars I think.",1,3,0,"1AxEmgv8Dsr3iU9Aa40jPw","kuNFy4pd9vIVj1yT4w_HVQ"

We both got burgers and they were 3-thumbs up!  Meat was juicy and flavorful but not greasy. The set-up was fresh and there were enough fries to be enjoyable, not menacing.  Deep Fried pickle spear on top is a whimsical touch but eat it FIRST while still hot for maximum enjoyment.  Would return YES. Would try other items YES.

Let's start with the good:  The staff was super friendly.  The fries are world class.  Don't know why, but they are.  The Nabers IPA on tap is a really good, refreshing, unoffensive example of the style.   If they sold it in stores I'd seek it out.  The mega pretzel appetizer was tasty and had just the right texture....but $7 is steep.  

Which leads me into the not-so-good.   The menu sounds great in theory, but the prices are on the high side, and the dishes we had just weren't all that good.   

My son's chicken strips were tough, and Naber's either needs to change the oil they're cooked in, or change brands/type of oil altogether.  Whatever it was left an \"off\" taste in them.  

 My wife's French Dip looked pretty good, the roll was decent enough, but the beef was tough and kind of tinny tasting.  Definitely \"meh\".  

I had the corn chowder and the Nuclear Shrimp appetizer together as my meal.   The chowder seems homemade, but it was unfortunately very bland.  A little blast of salt perked it right up though.   The Nuclear Shrimp were spicy indeed, but had also quite obviously been sitting at the kitchen window for a loooooong time.  Seems like the kitchen prepared them as an app and put them up but then they sat while the server waited to deliver them as a main course (as requested).  Better communication between the two would keep that from happening.  

And, we didn't get any place settings until after our meal was delivered.  That always irks me.    

The manager comped me one of my beers for my crappy shrimp plate without any prompting at all.  It's obvious they have customer satisfaction top of mind, but it would be better if they build that satisfaction with better execution in the first place.

Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!

When I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.

As for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.

If there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song. 

All in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.

Speaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.

Also, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!

The prices for an AYCE dinner of $19 weren't bad and their walk-up buffet selection seemed some-what alright, plus we had the option of ordering sushi from the menu (sashimi is always an extra $2 both at lunch and dinner), so we went for it.

The only vegetables they had at the buffet were cold, but the rest of the food wasn't bad. Then when placing our order for the sushi, the server missed part of the order due to being distracted by one of her co-workers across the restaurant which wasn't very pleasant. Regardless when the sushi arrived, I had a number of piece of it, and I started feeling sick to my stomach, so I decided to stop before it was too late. I was hoping we wouldn't be charged for the pieces we couldn't eat. Some of the pieces looked so slimy and unappealing, that we were convinced that if we were to try a piece, we'd be ill.

Fast forward three years... I came in with a friend around 9pm. The place was totally dead, and so was the brain of our waitress.

It seemed really dead and there was barely anyone in there. The staff member didn't ask us anything and merely pointed to a seat. The place was not clean, and had flies buzzing all around.

The employee wasn't very alert in doing his job and would take out his phone from time to time and go for a smoke. There's nothing wrong with a smoke break, but coming back to your work environment smelling like smoke and touching my food is a different story.

I have given this place many chances, but it is always nasty.

The rolls are chock full of rice and not much else.

The buffett (I'm not a fan of places that have the food lying out like that) is always half empty and nothing is delicious.

Oishi Sushi must be avoided at all costs.

"ujA5-PlHqH0_dZ1afcjo5g",1,"2012-09-18 00:00:00","I have ordered from Oishi several times and always been fairly satisfied with their food. The language barrier between the staff and their customers (those taking my order and delivery persons) has always been a pretty big issue, though. The food is sometimes very good, other times very mediocre but we have always liked the place....UNTIL

Last Saturday night we made a fairly large order as we were with friends. The delivery was said to be there in 45 minutes, it was an hour. Whatever. So the delivery guy comes, and brings in one bag full of our food. I went to take the bag from him but he stepped around me and put it behind me - this made me a little uncomfortable but whatever. He rushed me and dropped my change but I still tipped him well. Whatever.

So I watch him drive away as I lock my front door. Minutes later this guy is calling me on my cellphone YELLING and I can't understand a thing he's saying. After quite some time of him yelling some more I figure out that he's trying to tell me that I took too much food...like some one elses order. I checked and re-checked with the group, everyone got what they ordered - nothing more nothing less. So i tell the guy and he hangs up on my abruptly.

Next thing I know he's ringing our front doorbell again and again and again FRANTICALLY. My friend goes to the door because I don't like confrontation and wanted to finally start eating my meal. He demands to see me so I go and he starts accusing me of stealing another order of food. He said that he brought two bags into my house and said he would be right back for the second bag. This is entirely false 
1) Why the F#$K would you bring a different persons food into my house (his car was right outside)
2) He drove away after I paid him so clearly he wasn't coming back for this imaginary bag of food.

He then proceeded to call me a liar, and swear at me. I tried to calmly explain that there was some mistake but he left, still yelling, saying never to order from his business again. I was upset and irritated so I called the restaurant back immediately. I was not overly upset sounding but I tried to explain to the man who answered what had just happened. Obviously the delivery boy had already called because I got yelled at some more by this other man. Then I began to get upset. I told him that I was calling because I was accused of something I did not do and that I liked ordering from this place and I wanted to continue. The man kept repeating himself - no one would believe me (this was the owner) so he told me not to order from there again and hung up on me.

Needless to say this experience has ruined this places reputation in the eyes of some very loyal customers and their friends. I am appalled by the behaviour of this delivery boy AND the fact that the owner would back him up over a paying customer. Obviously this guy messed up hard and I got the crap end of the stick.

If I could give Oishi Sushi ZERO stars out of five I would. If I could give you any advice, it is to order from somewhere else. I will never be a loyal customer to a place that does not value the truth.",1,0,0,"Wf5C8Amv_SlhoYE3_W66WQ","WHMij0RtgB9aJQNn9KPFvQ"

Well it's not there which is why I asked.
The freshness of their sushi is a hit and miss.The white tuna wasn't very fresh the first time but it was quite delicious the second time I've been there.
You can order sashimi for lunch for an extra cost of $3 (which I think is worth it).

Show stealer: croissant. So good. Not too flaky but not not too solid either, wasn't too salty or too sweet, simply perfect. Probably the best croissant in montreal. I had the ham removed because i don't eat pork so my croissant came just with cream cheese but I'd rather have nothing on it and just go for plain croissant. I cannot stop fawning about how great the texture and softness of the croissant was. Next time I come, I'm simply getting a good ol' croissant avec cafe.

Everything else was great too but honestly the croissant was so good that the rest pales down to it. I also had a latte (they use beans by illy) which was also a rich and smooth blend of milk and coffee, not too bitter. Definitely recommend. All brunch plates also come with bread pudding (not my fav) and (super-duper) fresh orange juice.

Le Cartet fits more into the first category with a bit of the price factor of the latter. Located in a nice part of the area, it has an open and aesthetically pleasing layout to go along with the food served, a plus that never hurts.

I ordered the \"Le Nordique\" platter and a maple latte to go along with it. The maple latte, while it didn't have too much of a coffee taste to it, tasted delightful in regards to the quality of the maple flavoring without being overbearingly sweet. The Nordique platter consisted of a smoked salmon Eggs Benedict on a base of some type of black bread, a side salad, and some roasted potatoes. Raw onions garnished the Eggs Benedict, which I picked out since I absolutely detest them, but other than that they it was a really yummy dish. The bread base was also quite amazing and tasted more wholesome than your generic English muffin/white bread. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and seasoned so that they didn't taste bland like how potatoes often become, and the salad had a nice, light dressing to go along with it. The only issue that I had with the dish was that for $15.50, it seemed a bit pricey for how much food they gave, even though it was presented nicely. 

Le Cartet is definitely a great place if you want to enjoy a nice brunch in a chic environment. I would save it for occasions that lean more toward the special side, however, unless you have enough dough to spend on a regular basis (which as a university student I do not have, unfortunately).",0,0,0,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw"

"2KxOtsRcYSKhHfmUXGtsHA",4,"2011-08-05 00:00:00","Again, the yelp posting says its \"Good for Kids: Yes\" and I disagree slightly.  It's probably good for kids who can sit in their own seat and not in a high chair.  If you have a kid who needs a high chair, I would probably bring your own food for him/her.  The high chair that they brought was a bit disgusting. They obviously do not clean their high chairs every night. We were one of the first when they opened so it's not like tons of other kids used it before we got there.  Also the choices are few and far between for a one year old. There are no waffles, pancakes, or anything of that sort.

WIth that being said, my quiche was tasty and was accompanied by a lovely side salad.  The coconut banana bread was also very yummy, not too sweet and not too coconutty.  My husband ordered the crab extravaganza - crab benedict, crab cakes, and some other crab item.  All were tasty.

Our waiter was a bit stand-offish. I speak french but decided to speak english here and I felt like I paid for it. The waiter was unaccomodating, didn't smile, and ignored us.  We had to wave him down everytime we needed something. It's unfortunate. There was another waiter who stopped by to say hello to my daughter who was very sweet so I don't think all of their staff is half-bad.

I would go back for sure...for the food and when my daughter is older!",0,0,0,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","L4b1mw47A8AWWMOGrAY9_w"

Gets pretty packed after 10 am weekends. Love the wooden communal tables and the loft style ceilings. Portions are perfect and the coffee is excellent. Great service. Great clean modern décor.",1,0,1,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","MAd6aQ_PmH3tSiNy2PdEhw"

The plate was exquisite, service was top notch and the ambiance was excellent. 

Just what the doctor ordered. And everyone that works here is a professional. That's quite rare. 

To top it off, the quality you get for the price is probably unique in MTL for breakfast/brunch. 

Healthy and more more decadent options are available, the coffee is great and the staff is friendly. 

Posted this while still seated. 

Must try.",0,0,0,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","0ZQMbnBUpuMpf1_DiT3HyQ"

Such wonderful food that I think is healthful but doesn't taste like health food.  Despite the bustling flow of people through the place, the staff remains enjoyable.

The coffee here, and frankly at every restaurant I've visited in Montreal, is like Startbucks' drip on a bad day. Hoping to have better luck at a coffee-centric cafe.

The only thing good here was the croissant sandwich, which even these guys couldn't get wrong...",2,2,1,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","u75y2F52qlAnqFhNuZFbKw"

Les brunchs semblent savoureux, mais les portions sont énormes. Pour éviter de gaspiller la nourriture, j'ai opté pour un des plus petits déjeuners sur le menu, composé de yogourt grec, granola, bleuets et salade de fruits. Pour une dizaine de dollars, je crois que c'était assez décent comme assiette. 

Toutefois, je ne suis pas particulièrement impressionnée par cette première expérience. Il faut dire que je m'attendais à être absolument sous le charme après avoir lu autant d'éloges au sujet de ce restaurant. 

D'une part, je déteste devoir attendre pour déjeuner. Le matin, j'ai faim. Je veux m'asseoir et manger. Tout de suite. Pas attendre une éternité debout avec le ventre qui gargouille à en déranger les gens derrière moi. (Désolée, je deviens rapidement grumpy quand j'ai faim!)

L'ambiance est certes conviviale, mais l'endroit est hyper bruyant. 

Je vais peut-être lui donner une seconde chance, mais je ne crois pas ajouter Le Cartet à ma liste de lieux favoris pour bruncher...",0,0,0,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","-TY8OmgqWG9i2xlgEhr8pA"
"2zoCOojS7KK_JmiaphzfEg",4,"2011-07-30 00:00:00","Sometimes life gets too busy or exciting for mundane things like getting groceries or cooking, and you need a neighbourhood go-to place where you can pick up a relatively healthy meal on the run. For me, Le Cartet is that place. I know I can always grab a goat yogurt, a fruit cup, and an Illy coffee for breakfast. For lunch, they have a nice selection of sandwiches and salads. My favourite is a salad with salmon two ways: smoked and flaked with some mayo. The shelves are full of a variety of gourmet items, including enough varieties of fancy chocolate to keep even the most die-hard chocoholic busy for days on end. They also do a pretty killer brunch and a decent sit-down lunch. In summer they have a few tables on the McGill sidewalk.",0,0,0,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","HQv3cpiQz4vd7LWyn7JH1Q"

The pulled pork sandwich was okay. Moist but not very well flavored. The bread was well toasted but bland. The dish was just boring. The salmon tartar was delicious, as was the Bloody Caesar. I was told the gazpacho and chicken sandwich was good. The fish of the day, a white fish, was also bland and dry on the inside.",0,0,0,"58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw","hF40iD4UqSplkW5CvFcYyA"
